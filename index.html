    <h2>This is Just for You ❤️</h2>
    <p>
        I’ve put so much effort into this, just for you. Not because I had to, but because I wanted to.  
        Every small detail, every word, every moment spent on this it all means one thing, I really care about you. Please don't keep pushing me away.
    </p>
     <p>
        Do you know how rare people like you are?  
        You're someone who doesn’t just dream of adventure—you chase it.  
        You don’t wait for things to happen; you make them happen.  
        You work part-time, save your own money, and travel the world without asking for a single cent from home.  
        That level of independence, courage, and determination? It’s not just admirable—it’s extraordinary.  
    </p>
     <p>
        And maybe that’s why I feel so connected to you.  
        We’re miles apart, but somehow, we’re still so similar—like we’ve known each other for years.  
        I haven’t asked my dad for money since I started working either.  
        We both know what it’s like to stand on our own, to carve our own paths.  
        Maybe that’s why I see something in you that I’ve never seen in anyone else.  
    </p>
    <p>
        Now don't just ignore me or stop talking to me. Please.   
        I know we’re miles apart, but does that really mean we close the door forever?  
        The physical distance between our countries doesn’t matter—I can be there anytime. 
        I can be there anytime, with pav bhaji in one hand and a playlist of your favorite songs in the other.  
        Maybe, just maybe, there’s something between us. Who knows?   
        But if we never give it a chance, we’ll never know.  
    </p>
    <p>
        I don’t believe distance should decide our story. You love traveling, right? So why not take a leap an adventure worth remembering? Don’t say never, You mean a lot to me, and I don’t believe distance should decide our story.  
        So, please, don’t say never.  
    </p>
    <p>  
        I can do anything for you.  
    </p>
    <h3>Just don’t shut me out. ❤️</h3>
    <h3>Call me and tell me how is this. I’ll be waiting.❤️</h3>
